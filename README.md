# MorceCodeTranslator

## Project Outline

This Project is a morse code tranlator that on a web page will allow a user to input english and morse code, and then receive an output translated as the other.

## How to use the Project

This project uses HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript. Does not require any extensions to run.

## Extensions

The Extensions used to build this project are:

-   Live Server by Ritwick Dey
-   SASS package

## MVP

Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code

Create JS functions that would allow the user to:

-   Translate their English text into Morse Code
-   Morse Code into English text
    Make sure to handle spaces properly
-   ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters
-   Keep your pure functions separated from the JS DOM interaction code.

## Project Design

The project required the design to simply have a way to input text and have a way to show an output. So the design I used is incredibly simple. Simple form that has a header, two text boxes and a button. With some colour to help add with the visuals.

## Struggles

Finding a way to properly separate and re-join the words in both and english and morse code was a small struggle since the way morse code is written, the spaces differ greatly and finding ways to fix those gaps was good practice.
